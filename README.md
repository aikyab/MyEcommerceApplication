# MyEcommerceApplication

This is an E-Commerce Web-Application that I developed using Spring Boot as the back-end. The project contains multiple services to enable logistics and implements a heavy back-end for all such services.

The API's have been implemented using Spring Rest Controllers. The Service Layer consists of all the logic to keep the website functioning without any errrors. The repository layer uses MySQL as the database and EntityManager for communicating updates to the database, everytime any change is incurred on the front-end.

For the front-end I have used Angular in conjunction with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. Additionally, I have used sessionstorage to store the session data of the user. This is a simple alternative to what Redux does in React Architecture.
